This is the dotnet api server for my Websockets chat app. The purpose of this project was to demonstrate being able to send websockets messages to the frontend which receives them and turns them into nxrg actions on the front end of my angular app. The api is running on a droplet (vm) on Digital Ocean. You can see the app running at http://wschatfrontend.s3-website-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/
